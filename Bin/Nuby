# The purpose of this script is to quickly grab the correct interpreter 
# in a landscape of changing environments or to specify a particular 
# required interpreter. Also because I am lazy and typing out the 
# whole shebang is boring. 
# Todo: Menu for selecting from a set of available interpreters. 

## Usage: Nuby <Interpreter> <filename>
## This also pops you right into VIM. 

terpreter=$1
Nuby=$(which $terpreter) ; printf '#!'"$Nuby\n\n" > $2 ; vim $2
